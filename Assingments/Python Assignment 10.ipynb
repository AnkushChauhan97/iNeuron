    "**Ans:** `shutil.copy()` method is used to copy the contents of a file from one file to another file/folder, it primary takes two arguments `src`,`dest`, `src` represents the file to be copied where as destination refers to the file/folder to where the `src` data should be copied, if `dest` is a folder name the `src` with exact name will be copied to the `dest` folder, if its a file then the contents of `src` will be copied to `dest` where `dest` retains it name.\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.copytree()` function is used to copy the entire contents of a folder to other folder. it also takes two arguments `src` & `dest`, it copies all the content recursively and stores it in `dest`. the important catch here is `dest` must not exist prior to this and it will be created during the copy operation. Permissions and times of directories are copied with `shutil.copystat()` and individual files are copied using `shutil.copy2()` by default which can be modified using `copy_function` attribute."

The other functions with similar functionality are `os.remove()` -> removes a file, `os.rmdir()` removes a empty directory. The problem with these functions is once a file is deleted. it will be lost permanently, if a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file\n",
