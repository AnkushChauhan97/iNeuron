    "**Ans:** A Python class is like an mold for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. Every time a class object is initiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from that class.\n",

In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes that you want to include in your application."
